>>
3. If you want the user to input an integer value into your program for a
variable named number , what are two lines of code you could write to
ask the user to do it and to input the value into your program?

int number;
cout << "Input integer: ";
cin >> number;

4. What is \n called and what purpose does it serve?

special character, create new line
5. What terminates input into a string?

6. What terminates input into an integer?


7. How would you write

cout << "Hello, ";
cout << fi rst_name;
cout << "!\n";

as a single line of code?

cout << "Hello, " << first_name << "\n";

8. What is an object?

9. What is a literal?

a way of writting to state a value is a particular type
10. What kinds of literals are there?

named object
12. What are typical sizes for a char , an int , and a double ?

char 1 byte
int 4 byte
double 8 byte
13. What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such
as int s and string s?
14. What is the difference between = and == ?

= is operator for assignment
== is logical comparison equal
15. What is a definition?
